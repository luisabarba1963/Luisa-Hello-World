# Luisa Hello-World

This is my first repository.

I made it for practicing the GitHub Flow and see how GitHub connects with Zenodo.

It is good practice to do some exercises in a protected environment before going into the open with a true project.

To get started with this project, accept my invitation. I'm currently working on sending out invitations.

For any question, contact me at the mdmc course.

I will maintain this project as long as I deem it useful.

After publishing the first release, I obtained a DOI from Zenodo for citation and research purposes. Here it is:

<a href="https://handle.stage.datacite.org/10.5072/zenodo.112755"><img src="https://sandbox.zenodo.org/badge/864910571.svg" alt="DOI"></a>
