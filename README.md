# Luisa-Hello-World
This is my first repository.

I made it for practicing the GitHub Flow and see how GitHub connects with Zenodo.

It is good practice make some exercise in a protected environment before going in the open with a true project

To get started with this project, accept my invitation (still working on how to send them though)

For any question, write to me at luisa.barba@cnr.it

I will maintain this project as long as I deem it useful.

After publishing the first release, got DOI from Zenodo. Here it is:

<a href="https://handle.stage.datacite.org/10.5072/zenodo.112755"><img src="https://sandbox.zenodo.org/badge/864910571.svg" alt="DOI"></a>
